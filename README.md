## Project Overview

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to work on a large design that also includes the hardware implementation of several types of digital signal processing algorithms. In addition, the hardware design and implementation must meet the 50 MHz clock constraint, some latency constraints (defined indirectly through multiplier utilization constraints), while ensuring that hardware resources are not wasted.
